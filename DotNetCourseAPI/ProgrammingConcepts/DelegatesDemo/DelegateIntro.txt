Delegates:
It is a type safe function pointer.
A Delegate hold a reference to a method and then calls the method for execution.

To call a method using a delegate we have 3 steps

1: Define a Delegate
Syntax: => [<modifier>] delegate [return type] <Name>([<parameter list>]) it is very similar to method except we have to use Delegate Keyword
Example: 
public delegate void AddDelegate(int a, int b)

Two Points to remember when defining the delegate
1: The return type of Delegate should always be consistent with the return type of Method for which a delegate is holding a reference. 
2: The Parameters of the Delegate should always be the same type as of the parameters used in Methods.


1: Delegates are defined under NameSpaces. But can also be defined inside a class (a nested type)
2: Instance of the Delegate
